            // Then e(A,B) = e(alpha1,beta2) * e(alpha1,beta2) * e(alpha1,beta2) which is hard to satisfy.

            // (where -P means the inverse of P in the elliptic curve group)

            // For simplicity of the dummy test, we'll just do one pairing.
            // THIS IS NOT A REAL GROTH16 VERIFICATION.

            // A real verifier is much more complex and specific to the circuit.
            // If we just check e(_pA, vk.beta2) == e(vk.alfa1, _pB) this is too simple.

            // Let's use the actual pairing product structure a real verifier uses,
            // but with simplified L.
            // L = IC[0] + IC[1]*pubSignals[0] (for N_PUBLIC_INPUTS=1)
            // We can't do scalar mult easily.
            // A verifier from snarkjs bakes this into the points.
            // For testing, we assume we have A, B, C and the VK such that the equation will hold.
            // The key equation is: A * B = alpha * beta + (sum pub_i * IC_i) * gamma + C * delta
            // which translates to: e(A, B) = e(alpha, beta) * e( L, gamma ) * e(C, delta)

            // For this test, we'll bypass the complex L calculation and just check structure.
            // A truly "minimal" check to see if pairing works:
            // return Pairing.pairing(_pA, vk.beta2); // This is too simple and not a real proof check.

            // A real verifier generated by snarkjs for a circuit with 1 public input
            // (`_pubSignals[0]`) and a verifying key `vk` would look like this:
            Pairing.G1Point memory krs = vk.IC[0]; // This is vk_x0
            // This loop correctly forms the sum_i pub_i * IC_i for the L term
            // In a real verifier, this scalar multiplication is "compiled in"
            // For N_PUBLIC_INPUTS = 1: krs = vk.IC[0] + vk.IC[1] * _pubSignals[0]
            // We must simulate this for the dummy test.
            // If _pubSignals[0] is, say, `s0`, then the point is `s0 * vk.IC[1]`.
            // We can't compute `s0 * vk.IC[1]` easily in Solidity.
            // So, for our DUMMY proof, we will ensure `_pC` is crafted to make the equation balance
            // assuming `krs` is just `vk.IC[0] + vk.IC[1]` (i.e., _pubSignals[0] = 1).
            // Or, even simpler for the dummy, let krs = vk.IC[0] and _pubSignals[0] has no effect on it
            // for our *dummy proof crafting only*.

            // To make the dummy test pass with a simple structure:
            // Assume our dummy proof (A, B, C) and vk are such that:
            // e(A, B) = e(alpha1, beta2)
            // And L (from pubSignals and IC) makes other terms cancel to 1, or C is chosen for that.
            // For the dummy test, let's set up the pairing product as if L = IC[0]
            // and C is such that e(C, delta2) = 1_T (e.g. C is identity or delta2 is identity).
            // And we craft A, B, alpha1, beta2 so e(A,B) = e(alpha1, beta2).

            // This is the actual pairing equation that needs to hold:
            // e(_pA, _pB) = e(vk.alfa1, vk.beta2) * e(krs, vk.gamma2) * e(_pC, vk.delta2)
            // Rearranged for precompiled contract (product form):
            // e(_pA, _pB) * e(vk.alfa1, NEG(vk.beta2)) * e(krs, NEG(vk.gamma2)) * e(_pC, NEG(vk.delta2)) = 1_T
            // (where NEG means finding the elliptic curve point inverse for the G2 elements)

            // To test our Pairing library and structure, we will need to provide _pA, _pB, _pC, _pubSignals
            // AND a VerifyingKey (vk.alfa1, vk.beta2, etc.)
            // For the DUMMY PROOF, we will cheat:
            // Let _pA = vk.alfa1
            // Let _pB = vk.beta2
            // Let krs = Point of Origin (so e(krs, gamma2) = 1)
            // Let _pC = Point of Origin (so e(_pC, delta2) = 1)
            // Then the equation e(A,B) = e(alpha,beta) * 1 * 1 holds.
            // "Point of Origin" for G1 is (0,0) but this is not a valid point on the curve usually.
            // A valid point that acts like an identity for pairings is more complex.
            // A common G1 identity is (1,0) sometimes, or specific conventional points.

            // The most robust way to test this structure for Week 4 (without a real ZK toolkit yet)
            // is to get a real proof + vk + public inputs from a simple Circom example (e.g., multiplier2)
            // and hardcode those values into the test.

            // --- SIMPLIFIED DUMMY CHECK for Week 4 structure test ---
            // This does NOT verify a real Groth16 proof. It only checks if the
